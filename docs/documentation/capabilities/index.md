## Capabilities

Markup is a powerful templating system from which you can build anything upon. From simple applications to enterprise size applications, Markup is simple enough to support the building blocks to build anything.

Before Semicolon already offers additional libraries you can use to build web applications all built on top of Markup:

-   [Web Component](./web-component.md);
-   [Router](./router.md);

Additionally, here are example of things you can build using just the Markup APIs:

-   [Function Component](./function-component.md);
-   [State Management Store](./state-store.md);
-   [Server Side Rendering](./server-side-rendering.md);
