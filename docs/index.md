### Why Markup?

**_We believe that Web Standards, Web APIs, and modern JavaScript are all you need to build any web based project_**. Markup only exists to provide you with all the reactivity and a simpler way to represent your HTML in JavaScript to build anything - _No build required!_

-   **Reactive**
    Markup uses JavaScript [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) and [Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions) to allow you to create reactive DOM with state management, render lifecycles, side effects control, and more.
-   **Small**
    Markup allows you to do a lot with **9Kb compressed** code (**_18Kb umcompressed_**). From prototyping to enterprise web applications, ship it with confidence!
-   **Simple**
    Markup is **[based on Web Standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/)** and exposes 3 simple APIs you can use to enhance Web Components APIs, working with DOM, and building any Web User Interface.
-   **Plug & Play**
    Markup requires no build and no parsing. You can simply add it to your project and start using it. It is just an extension of the familiar _HTML + CSS + JavaScript_ we love.
-   **Web Component**
    Markup enhances Web Component APIs with reactivity and by eliminating the need to perform DOM manipulations when creating components for your projects.
-   **Performance**
    Markup is data driven and handles everything behind the scenes which allows the DOM to only be updated when and where it is necessary.
