### Why Markup?

-   **Reactive**
    Markup uses JavaScript **[template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)** and Functions to allow you to create reative DOM with state management, render lyfecycles, and side effects control.
-   **Small**
    Markup allows you to do a lot with **9Kb compressed** code (**_18Kb umcompressed_**. From prototyping to enterprise web applications, you can ship it to the client confidently!
-   **Simple**
    Markup is **[based on Web Standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/)** and exposes 3 simple APIs you can use to enhance Web Components APIs, working with DOM, and building any Web User Interface.
-   **Plug & Play**
    Markup requires no build, no parsing, no bundling. You can simply add it to your project and start using it. This is because it is based on web standards and looks super familiar.
-   **Web Component**
    Markup enhances Web Component APIs with reactivity and by eliminating the need to perform DOM manipulations when creating components for your projects.
-   **Performance**
    Markup is data aware and handles everything behind the scenes which allows the DOM to only be updated when ands where it is necessary.
